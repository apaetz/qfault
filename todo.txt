- Component IDs require redefinition of _hashStr for components with extra internal data.  Better solution?
- Simply inserting a syndrome in place of an LED will not work, because order-1 errors can occur even conditioned on acceptance.
Instead, could count all possible combinations of two overlapping exRecs and condition on the first exRec being bad.
 - Modify TECDecodeAdapter to also calculate 1-block syndrome counts (upper bounds) for each type of logical error.


- Eliminate dead code.
