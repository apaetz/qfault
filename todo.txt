- get concurrency to work for lambda functions.
	-- It is difficult or impossible to use lambda functions with the Python multiprocessing
	   module.  The reason is that lambda functions can't be pickled.  Parts of lambda function
	   *can* be marshaled.  But I have not found a complete recipe that reliably reconstructs
	   the entire lambda function. In particular, it is not clear how to reliably reconstruct
	   the func_closure attribute. 
	   See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11878300/serializing-and-deserializing-lambdas
- Re-organize test code (compare to sympy, and check distutils options)
- Re-write location counting for separate kx, kz params
- Combine component counting and simulation.

- Pr[Sin=s] bounds are far too generous.  Need to tighten up.

-Order-2 Logical X/Z error counts for TeleportED seem high.  Should check some of the counts by hand.
  - Looks like the order two counts are better now that the kGood bug has been fixed.  Alternating gauge types (see below)
  also help.

- All teleportation components use Bell states with logica |+> gauge qubits.  This gives extra Z-error protection only.
Should balance it out by using |0> gauge qubits on some error detections. 
- Knill scheme threshold is dominated by the case in which the input error to both blocks is trivial.
Is there a way to improve the counts for this case?
- Scheme code is not well thought-out.

- Component IDs require redefinition of _hashStr for components with extra internal data.  Better solution?

- keyPropagator() and propagateCounts() are not well defined for all components (i.e. postselecting components). An equivalent
way to propagate keys is to call count() with kMax=0, which is well defined for all components.
