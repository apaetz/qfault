- Update scheme code based on re-worked component behavior.
- Scheme code is not well thought-out.

- Component IDs require redefinition of _hashStr for components with extra internal data.  Better solution?

- keyPropagator() and propagateCounts() are not well defined for all components (i.e. postselecting components). An equivalent
way to propagate keys is to call count() with kMax=0, which is well defined for all components.

- Eliminate dead code.
